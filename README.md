# Evaluating Wind Turbine Performance Improvement Using Regression
A renewable energy company wants to evaluate and quantify the improvement in a wind turbine's energy generation performance after installing hardware on the turbine's blades claimed to improve aerodynamics. This project aims to model the wind turbine generation before and after the improvement activities were done, excluding any other factors that may affect the turbine generation such as difference in wind speed, turbine stoppages, and grid curtailment, and compare the predictions of the models to determine whether there is an improvement in generation, and by how much.
